This is a simple command-line To-Do application built with Python that allows users to manage tasks efficiently. Users can add, view, update, and delete tasks through a text-based menu interface. Each task can include a description and a status (e.g., pending or completed). The app stores tasks in a file or in memory (depending on implementation) and ensures that changes are saved across sessions if persistence is enabled. It's a lightweight, beginner-friendly project that demonstrates basic Python concepts like functions, loops, conditionals, and file handling without relying on external libraries.
